# Security Policy

## Security Model

Oasis is experimental software, please don't trust it with your life.

If everything is working correctly, it's likely that:

- Only your computer can access Oasis.
- Only you can publish a message to your feed.
- Only the recipients of private messages can read the message.
- Only basic HTML is supported in blobs, which can't access the rest of Oasis.

It's important to know that this is not a silver bullet:

- Your public messages can be read by anyone on the Secure Scuttlebutt network.
- Your public messages can be read by anyone on the Secure Scuttlebutt network.
- Your IP address can be seen by anyone that peers with you.
- Your private messages can be read by anyone with access to your private key.

You should also know:

- Information that others can read can be saved, without your permission.
- Encryption techniques that are unbreakable today may become compromised in the future; maybe in dozens or hundreds of years.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported.
