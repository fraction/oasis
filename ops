Could you expand on this bit?\n\n\u003e This makes it difficult to scroll using a mouse or on a touchscreen.\n\nWould this be resolved by making the scrollbars bigger? The scrollbar colors were changed because they're used in themes, and usually the default scrollbar colors conflict with the theme colors, but It's important to me that the scrollbars are still easy to use.\n\nHere are some screenshots of a random scrollbar with the theme + without the theme:\n\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-26 14-02-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537700/73142519-7ef28c00-4044-11ea-86be-75a4067a86ca.png)\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-26 14-01-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537700/73142520-7ef28c00-4044-11ea-9845-a20142eb14bf.png)\n\nPut another way: how can we improve the scrollbars without breaking theme support?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"891639547a1f727a0462fc4a3024dbc85157d510"},"timestamp":1580077629,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODU0OTg2NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/84#issuecomment-578549864"},"message":"Ah I probably jumped the gun on this a bit. I think it could be improved by being around 5 times longer than it currently is. This would make it very similar to the scrollbar on Mastodon which is probably fine. \n\n## Mastodon v3.0.1 Scroll Bar \n![Screenshot from 2020-01-26 22-26-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18296993/73142805-e3d0d500-408a-11ea-9903-c920a5baa54e.png)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"6a0aeab8ae8e7bf93407c51e9b2a4d9d0273c9ad"},"timestamp":1580081093,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODU1NDEwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/84#issuecomment-578554106"},"message":"Hmm, I don't think that's something that we have control over -- the scrollbar height is determined by the size of the webpage, so the bigger the webpage is the smaller the scrollbar is. Right now I think it shows 64 messages on each page, but I'm happy to reduce that once we have pagination working.","files":null}]}
