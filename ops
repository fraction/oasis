In Oasis there are three actions:\n\n- **Root:** Start a new thread by creating a message without any ancestors.\n- **Comment:** Add a response to an entire thread (which is a **root** or **reply**, plus its comments).\n- **Reply:** Add a response to a specific **comment**.\n\nI think Patchwork uses the word 'fork' instead of 'reply', but there's also this other unrelated thing where you make a new root and reference a message which people *also* call a 'fork'.\n\nAlso worth noting: Patchwork doesn't support adding a **comment** to a **reply**, they just add another reply as a sibling.
