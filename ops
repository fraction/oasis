Once I'm done with a message I'd like for it to be hidden somehow, but I'm not sure the best way to do this.\n\n**Is there a solution you'd like to recommend?** Maybe each message should have a 'archive' button and each feed should have a way to filter those out? I know that Patchbay has an 'unread' plugin that marks a message as 'read' once it appears on your screen for some amount of time, but I think there are two problems:\n\n- I read lots of stuff that I want to reply to later. I'd rather have this be an explicit thing where I choose when I'm done with a message.\n- The unread plugin exists outside of the SSB log, so it doesn't persist via SSB. If we make this an explicit manual action I think that we can safely post this as a private message to ourselves, whereas making it automatic probably makes the volume of messages unreasonably large.\n\nWhat's the best way to do this?","files":null}]}
