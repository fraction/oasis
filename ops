I'm usually only interested in threads started by, or participated in, by people I directly follow.\n\n**Is there a solution you'd like to recommend?**\nSmall scale solution: limit those views to people I follow.\n\nHere's the [query for Latest](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/src/models/index.js#L585).  I don't know how to filter it by people I'm following (easier) or comments on threads started by people I'm following (trickier)\n\nLarge scale solution: If I was redesigning the navbar from scratch I would make the Gradient of Intimacy the first choice in the hierarchy, with filter options below it:\n\n[Everyone]  [People you follow]  **[Mutual friends]**  [PMs]\n...their [x] Posts   [ ] Comments  [ ] Likes\n...sort by: Latest / Popular today / Popular this week","files":null}]}
