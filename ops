It's *probably* the right thing to get identity management working first but I'm in baby-step mode right now.\n\nI think the cookie approach sounds great. Do you have any recommendations for internationalization modules? My only experience has been with Patchwork's system.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"9021ca3e4c742b59e6879a829fbe093e2fdb3d2e"},"timestamp":1562940038,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDg5NzQxMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/4#issuecomment-510897411"},"message":"I don't. patchwork has a fairly ad-hoc one, and I wanted to use it. A basic js object seems like it should be enough. I wanted to use the patchwork one, but I found it rather awkward that the key was whole string in english, because if patchwork changes this, all the other objects need to change too. This might work for patchwork, but seems very fragile if you are using it as a dep.\n\nI'd rather have variable names as keys for the messages, so the text descriptions can change easily,\neven but the key names stay stable.\n```\n  \"Friends\": \"Friends\",\n  \"FriendsDescription\": \"you both follow each other\"\n```\n\nIt just occured to me that if patchwork wanted still use the full string as the key, you could have a thing that just traversed the object to find the english string, grabbed the key, then used that.","files":null}]}
