In the future I'd like to handle this manually so that we can server appropriately-sized avatar images instead of using gigantic images scaled down to avatar size. \n\nI think we just need to make a context menu to open images in Patchwork and then this should be resolved (see https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-markdown/pull/29).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"71f5fe2fc3d873c514cc4e11fefec5167f91dbe0"},"timestamp":1565994451,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjE3MDE5NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/3#issuecomment-522170195"},"message":"This might be trickier to support for use cases where oasis is running behind a reverse proxy.
