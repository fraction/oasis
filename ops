Otherwise they might think that e.g. editing away personal information will be effective.\n\nBut overall I'm excited to try this!  I have a lot of questions but that doesn't mean I'm opposed:\n\nThis would be the first client using the edit plugin?  https://github.com/fraction/ssb-edit/network/dependents\n\nIs there a spec for these `edit` messages?  The `ssb-edit` code looks like a view for indexing them but doesn't describe the format for publishing them, and the expected semantics around them.  Has this format been discussed w/ the community?\n\nWhat types of messages can be edited?\n\nCan anyone edit a message or is it limited to the original author?\n\nI think the index uses the last edit message in the order provided by flume.  If using `ssb-ooo`, could the messages be out of order so that the wrong one is chosen?\n\nIt looks like editing is done by publishing a `type: edit` message which is expected to supersede the original.  Those messages will be invisible in most clients.  Could it be more backwards-compatible to publish the edits as regular message types, with an additional key like `replaces: \"%abc...\n\"`, so that they will visible in older clients (graceful degradation style).\n\nSome other message types are already editable e.g. the last one is considered to supersede the previous ones (`about`, `gathering`, `contact`).  Do they have a uniform format for referring back to the thing they're replacing?\n\n(sorry for the wall of questions, this feels like an ecosystem-level decision to make with care)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"15be4af55ad83e3dbe17b7c1fb3a4889aa5fa3cd"},"timestamp":1579728449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzM5Mzg2NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/64#issuecomment-577393865"},"message":"\u003e How about a delayed post plugin?
