When Matt broke up with Patchwork I looked around and realized that there weren't any other apps that I'd recommend for most people, so I started taking the two-pronged approach of:\n\n- Take care of Patchwork and keep it on life support until a next-generation SSB interface is ready.\n- Start building a next-generation interface that's easier to use / improve / maintain.\n\n\u003e Is it meant to be run locally as an alternative to patchwork?\n\nYeah, my personal use-case is an alternative to Patchwork that can either attach to an existing SSB service or start its own, plus I use [a branch](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/tree/public) that acts as a [public SSB viewer](https://oasis-demo.fraction.io/).\n\n\u003e Is it meant to be hosted and used by multiple users?\n\nIt could be hosted somewhere (and secured with *at least* a password and TLS) if you want to be able to post to the same feed from multiple devices, but this loses many of the benefits of SSB's offline-first design. I'm planning to add identity switching, so that you can choose which feed you're posting from, but I think I'd like to avoid Mastodon-style logins where you have to trust the server administrator not to use your private keys or read your encrypted messages.\n\nI know that @arj03 is working on [SSB-Browser](https://github.com/arj03/ssb-browser-demo), where the entire SSB node runs directly in your browser, which might cover the \"I want to try SSB but I don't want to install anything\" use-case, but I think it would be best to assume that anyone using Oasis can be trusted with all of the information that Oasis knows. The public viewer use-case is an exception to that, but that's not in `master` yet.\n\nOnce all of the basics are covered I'd really like to look into something like [choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo), which would allow Oasis to run on the server over HTTP *or* completely in the browser just like SSB-Browser does, but I'm trying not to get ahead of myself.\n\nWhat do you think?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"0545b519300de7456097c1900e58ca397b760668"},"timestamp":1577922969,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDA5NDA5NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/33#issuecomment-570094094"},"message":"What I got from your comment merged with context from the README:\n\u003e Friendly Scuttlebutt interface designed for simplicity and accessibility.
