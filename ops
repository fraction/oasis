For simplicity I've been targeting the latest active LTS + the latest bleeding-edge Node. I think that's coming from:\n\n```\nconst { readFile } = require('fs').promises\n```\n\nAnd Node 8 doesn't support promise-based FS.\n\nIf there's any reason it's a pain to use Node 10 I'm happy to target Node 8 too -- just let me know.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"6a0aeab8ae8e7bf93407c51e9b2a4d9d0273c9ad"},"timestamp":1577805941,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5MTU3NzUxODk="},"added":["topic:bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"541c5fe50dcfb0ec5c5e9e272e11e484738b2de9"},"timestamp":1577808038,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk1MDQ3MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/30#issuecomment-569950470"},"message":"Beautiful - it's working!\n\nRan into some problems trying to upgrade Node and then remembered to use `nvm` instead.
