Add ability to save settings in the backend (not to the SSB log, just a JSON file or something)\n2. Add checkbox to Meta screen\n3. Apply the setting when generating pages\n\nThere are other settings that would be nice like \"hide posts containing these words\" which could be added on top of this settings infrastructure once we have it.","files":null}]}
