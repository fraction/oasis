Maybe less useful on the firehose of public messages.\n\nFor read/unread, I'm not sure how to know when something has been meaningfully seen.  Maybe only if you look at the thread detail view?\n\nStars and inbox/archived could be private messages to yourself, and read/unread could be offchain since it will be so much data.\n\n---\n\nFor bookmarking and workflow reasons I'd love to have general purpose tagging of posts which is onchain and private-to-yourself, but that's getting out of scope :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"15be4af55ad83e3dbe17b7c1fb3a4889aa5fa3cd"},"timestamp":1579137684,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDkzNTg5NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/49#issuecomment-574935894"},"message":"The ability to mute a thread would be really nice for safety / calm / curation reasons.\n\nIt could be built on the same infrastructure as stars, read/unread, etc.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"6a0aeab8ae8e7bf93407c51e9b2a4d9d0273c9ad"},"timestamp":1579206859,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTMzNDI3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/49#issuecomment-575334274"},"message":"Thanks for thinking this through! I totally forgot about 'save for later', I think that would improve the \"read\" / \"unread\" thing. Dominic mentioned that he has to use \"mark as unread\" all the time on GitHub, which is sort of a silly and confusing semantic when *really* you just need a 'save'.\n\nI think I need to generalize the filter on the 'popular' pages so that you can do filters on others -- even just switching between 'inbox' and 'archive' would be super sweet on the 'private' page.\n\n\u003e The ability to mute a thread would be really nice for safety / calm / curation reasons.\n\nYup! I've been meaning to implement this but haven't come up with a good UI for un-muting.
