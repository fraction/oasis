This would serve the same function as for example running `oasis --tor` on the command line.\n\nYou should also be able to select the SOCKS proxy port. Port 9150 is the default local port for Tor Browser. This could also be useful for people who use a VPN with Scuttlebutt.\n\nThe goal is to make it easy for people who require location privacy to obscure their IP Address without needing to use the command line.","files":null}]}
