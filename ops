For example, we can now do multiple identities quite easily (using `ssb-identities`) but most clients assume that there is only a single identity.\n\nIn yap, I implemented this using cookies - the reason being that it makes the url generic - you could share a link if you wanted to, and it would make sense without knowing the selected user.\n(not that you really want to be able to share links, but it seemed like clean design)\n\nI planned the same approach for language. basically, you do a post, which sets the cookie. you just need an ordinary form on the front end.\n\nWhat do you think? I'm keen to have a back end that can work with oasis and yap.","files":null}]}
