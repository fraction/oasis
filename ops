Looking at the HTML, the button always submits a `voteValue` of `1`.\n\n**What did you expect to happen?**\nIf you've previously liked a post, maybe it should submit a `voteValue` of `0`?\n\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\nNope ❤️ \n\nI am guessing it needs to query each post to know if you're amongst the likers?","files":null}]}
