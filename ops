I like TypeScript, and I've used it professionaly, but I've been on the fence regarding whether I'd like to make \"learn TypeScript\" a mandatory part of working on Oasis.\n\nI'd be super supportive of adding TypeScript comments to the plain JS, and I think that would be an unambiguous win. JSDoc-style comments are well-known and supported by lots of tooling, and I think it'd be great to start adding types that way.","files":null}]}
