I think we should improve it, but I'm not sure how.\n\n**What do you think is the correct solution to this problem?** I think a Patchwork-style sidebar is reasonable on desktop, but I'm not sure what to do on mobile. Here's a very rough sketch that wouldn't take very long to implement:\n\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-16 11-48-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537700/70937945-1acaba00-1ffa-11ea-95c2-645e643c6517.png)\n\nI'm inspired to make a Shellogram-style sidebar that's more interactive, but I'm in some technical debt that would make that difficult right now. I should probably just repay that debt. My mistake was implementing a tree-like dependency graph where the most often-used tools (database connection, main template, etc) are leaf nodes, when *really* I think the leaf nodes should be the code that's used the least.\n\n## Now\n\n![index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537700/70938426-02a76a80-1ffb-11ea-9be7-3b1b32d7f362.png)\n\n## Maybe future?\n\n![maybe-future](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537700/70938671-76e20e00-1ffb-11ea-9560-99b5a73d0d79.png)\n\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?** Yep.","files":null}]}
