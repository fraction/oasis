Anything is better than what we have now. :~)\n\nThat link looks great. I've been struggling with the separate goals of *make form inputs match the theme* and *make form inputs familiar and easy to recognize*, and it hasn't always gone well. For example, I think the theme chooser is confusing, and when I watched a friend use it he selected \"set theme\" because it's impossible to tell that the `\u003cselect\u003e` is a dropdown menu. If we remove `appearance: none` then it shows the familiar button with an arrow, but there's no way to change the button/arrow colors.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f506d936028410197b6fff70b94c3833432a95b"},"timestamp":1578586765,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjYzNTI1Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/47#issuecomment-572635252"},"message":"If you can clearly state design goals like that, I know a css wizard at work who could help :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"97a3ff0c45ce6d6b8b06c58b6b722b7ada4f968f"},"timestamp":1578612431,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjgwMzgzOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/47#issuecomment-572803838"},"message":"My advise is to fill a `\u003cdatalist\u003e` with the names and ids of friends and following: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist\n\nIf you really want a dropdown, then it can be divided into sections using `\u003coptgroup\u003e` to organize the dropdown: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"6a0aeab8ae8e7bf93407c51e9b2a4d9d0273c9ad"},"timestamp":1578612793,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjgwNTQ2Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/47#issuecomment-572805467"},"message":"I think `\u003cdatalist\u003e` is perfect, it just means we need a \"add another recipient\" button that refreshes the page to add a second datalist, since we can't currently do `multiple`.
