Invalid dependency type requested: alias\"","message":"Starting at commit 393f7ef08708da0a23bc9da5b9729fd6ab2a5841 \"Update Common-Good to fix Windows problem\" I was unable to run `npm install`.\n\n`npm ERR! Invalid dependency type requested: alias`\n\nI had npm 6.3.0 and node v10.8.0 on OSX 10.11.6.\n\nApparently a dependency somewhere within `common-good` is using \"alias\" in package.json, which is a yarn feature that only became supported by [npm 6.9.0 released in March 2019](https://npm.community/t/release-npm-6-9-0/5911).  Unfortunately the npm log didn't specify which package was causing the problem.\n\nI updated npm using `npm install -g npm@latest`.  Now with npm 6.13.6, it all works.\n\nReporting this in case anyone else runs into it.","files":null}]}
