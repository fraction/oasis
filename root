I was thinking that the web demo would be good enough, but @cblgh asked for a screenshot of Oasis in the readme so that's probably a good idea.\n\n**Is there a solution you'd like to recommend?** Maybe one of us should take a screenshot and put it in the readme? We should probably respect `publicWebHosting` and be sure not to capture any information that the author hasn't said they're okay with sharing. Bonus points for a [slow] animated GIF of some of the themes?","files":null}]}
