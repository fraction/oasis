It would be great to have a development process in this app (that I'd love to also add to SSB-CLI and friends).\n\n**Is there a solution you'd like to recommend?** Since reading about the [Collective Code Construction Contract](https://github.com/zeromq/rfc/tree/master/42) I've been really itching to try it out. There's more info about it [here](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/social-architecture/content/chapter4.html), but the gist is \"patches should solve problems and pass tests, maintainers should merge all correct patches ASAP after review for **correctness only**\". I don't want to be a source of truth for this module and it's important to me that I'm not a bottleneck.\n\nThe only changes to C4 that I'd propose: \n\n\u003e A patch commit message MUST consist of a single short (less than 50 characters) line stating the problem (\"Problem: ...\") being solved, followed by a blank line and then the proposed solution (\"Solution: ...\").\n\nCommits in this format would be rad, but I can't imagine telling someone to amend their commit to follow this format. I think I'd like for \"MUST\" to be replaced with \"SHOULD\".\n\n\u003e The project SHALL NOT use topic branches for any reason. Personal forks MAY use topic branches.\n\nIn my experience the project repository is a very convenient place to push your topic branches. I'd be comfortable removing this rule.\n\ncc: @jedahan @trashhalo @cinnamon-bun @stripedpajamas @mycognosist @aadilayub","files":null}]}
