It's also nice to be prompted to re-read my message before posting it, for typos and to encourage reflection.\n\nThis also reduces the need for editable messages #64 \n\n**Is there a solution you'd like to recommend?**\n1. Change the \"Submit\" button to \"Preview\"\n2. Clicking Preview reloads the page, preserving the text in the input box, and adds a new preview box below it with rendered markdown and a Submit button.  Users can keep writing/editing and hit Preview again, or can Submit.\n\nOr we could go to a new screen showing just the editbox and preview, but I think users often refer back to the thread as they write.\n\nI'd vote for making people Preview before they can Submit, because I think this extra moment of reflection reduces flamewars.","files":null}]}
