While investigating the best systemic solution for #29 I saw some issues (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2042 and https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3266) that made me skeptical that Yarn is aligned with my values of beginner-friendly behavior.\n\n**What do you think is the correct solution to this problem?** It's super important to me that Oasis is easy and accessible for beginners, and I'd imagine that most beginners are using npm. Should we switch to using `npm` and replace `yarn.lock` with `package-lock.json`?\n\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?** Yes.\n\ncc: @cinnamon-bun @trashhalo  @jjehannet  @mycognosist","files":null}]}
