The same error is thrown if I try running `oasis` with a Scuttlebutt server already running. The error is: `Cannot read property 'readFile' of undefined`. The full output is as follows:\n\n```\noasis\n(node:8086) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): TypeError: Cannot read property 'readFile' of undefined\n  oasis Initial connection attempt failed +0ms\n  oasis Starting Scuttlebutt server +1ms\nssb-friends: stream legacy api used\n  oasis Retrying connection to own server +4s\n```\n\n**What did you expect to happen?**\nDeployment of the oasis web app.\n\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\nIf I were able to identify and fix the problem, sure. I can see that the `readFile` operation occurs in `index.js` but I'm not sure where `path` is defined.\n\nThanks for your time and effort, @christianbundy","files":null}]}
